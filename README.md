## About

ENIGMA (Enhanced NeuroImaging Genetics through MetaAnalysis) is a network that brings together researchers in imaging fields to share ideas, algorithms, data, and information.  The ENIGMA MRS group previously published a technical introduction to the use of MRS in pediatric and adult traumatic brain injury, outlining several considerations and recommendations to improve studies within this injury group ([Bartnik-Olson et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32797399/)) and more recently has published on considerations of data harmonization across multiple sides, with considerations of prospective study designs as well as retrospective data aggregation ([Harris et al. 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36686533/)). The MRS Group represents major academic sites including Harvard Medical School, Loma Linda University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Calgary, University of Florida, University of Dresden, Charité Berlin, and others. Through the combination of these sites, the ENIGMA MRS study group has a unique collection of what is likely the world’s largest collection of MR spectroscopy data.  In addition, each of the sites have collected hundreds of spectroscopy cases of normative data across ages.

This repository contains tools and resources to develop a normative single-voxel MRS database.
